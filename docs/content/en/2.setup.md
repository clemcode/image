## Installation

Add `@nuxt/image` devDependency to your project:

<code-group>
  <code-block label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn add --dev @nuxt/image
```

  </code-block>
  <code-block label="NPM">

```bash
npm install -D @nuxt/image
```

  </code-block>
</code-group>

Add the module to the `buildModules` of your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  buildModules: ['@nuxt/image']
}
```

<alert type="success">

That's it! You can can start using [`<nuxt-img>`](/components/nuxt-img) and [`<nuxt-picture>`](/components/nuxt-picture) components in your Nuxt app ✨

</alert>

## Configure

Add an `image` section in your `nuxt.config.js`:

```ts [nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  image: {
    // Options
  }
}
```

See [module options](/api/options).

## TypeScript

If you're using Typescript, add the types to your "types" array in `tsconfig.json` after the `@nuxt/types` (Nuxt 2.9.0+) or `@nuxt/vue-app` entry.

```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@nuxt/types", "@nuxt/image"]
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

To transform your images, Nuxt Image includes `sharp` as a dependency. If a node-gyp error occurs on installation:

- Your architecture is not supported by the pre-built binaries (e.g Apple M1). This means that npm has to build them from source. On Apple systems, this requires python and XCode, on Linux syatems python and gcc (`build-essentials`) and on windows, you can check installing requirements with node installer`
- Your lock file (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) references older versions of the libraries. Try to re-create your lock file by doing so:
  <code-group>
    <code-block label="Yarn" active>

  ```bash
  rm yarn.lock && yarn add
  ```

    </code-block>
    <code-block label="NPM">

  ```bash
  rm package-lock.json && npm install
  ```

    </code-block>
  </code-group>

- Your project contains a previous version of Nuxt Image. If so, try to upgrade :
  <code-group>
    <code-block label="Yarn" active>

  ```bash
  yarn upgrade @nuxt/image
  ```

    </code-block>
    <code-block label="NPM">

  ```bash
  npm up @nuxt/image
  ```

    </code-block>
  </code-group>

- If none of the above worked, please fill an issue here : [https://github.com/nuxt/image/issues](https://github.com/nuxt/image/issues). Please include error trace, OS, Node version and the package manager used for installing.
