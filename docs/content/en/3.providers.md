## Default provider

Nuxt Image comes with a preconfigured instance of [IPX](/providers/ipx) to provide images transformations based on the [Sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) package. That default provider can be used without any configuration. The module will automatically optimize `<nuxt-img>` or `<nuxt-picture>` sources and accepts all [options](/api/options/), except for modifiers which are specific to image services providers.

With Universal target, IPX will generate correct images at runtime. With static target, IPX will generate all optimized assets on `nuxt generate` and store them in the `dist` folder.

## Image Services Providers

Providers are an integration between the Image module and image services providers. Using a specific provider means that your images will be transformed into URLs from the image service.

There are plenty of image service providers. Nuxt Image has a generic way to work with external providers. Here is a complete list of providers that are supported out-of-the-box and can be easily configured to use.

- [`Cloudinary`](/providers/cloudinary)
- [`Fastly`](/providers/fastly)
- [`Imgix`](/providers/imgix)
- [`IPX`](/providers/ipx) (selfhosted)
- [`Prismic`](/providers/prismic)
- [`Sanity`](/providers/sanity)
- [`Twicpics`](/providers/twicpics)
- [`Storyblok`](/providers/storyblok)

If you are looking for a specific provider outside of this list, you can [create your own provider](/advanced/custom-provider).
